function [featIm] = extractTextonHists(origIm, bank, textons, winSize)
    % Given a grayscale image, filter bank, and texton codebook, construct a texton histogram for each pixel based on the frequency of each texton within its neighborhood (as defined by a local window of fixed scale winSize). Note that textons are discrete. A pixel is mapped to one discrete texton based on its distance to each texton. (see quantizeF eats above). where textons is a k Ã— d matrix.
